# TASK

Imagine you are creating a graphics editor.
Think over the class hierarchy. There should be at least:

 - a base class for the shapes.Shape. This class should have a method for displaying the shape's name.
 - classes that inherit from shapes.Shape - Circle, Quad, etc. - at least five options.
 - there should be a class that accepts a shape and displays its name. The class should work specifically with the shapes.Shape base class.

Pay attention to the use of OOP tools - interfaces, abstract classes, access modifiers.
